# Hilbert-curve-picture-compression
Comparing the hilbert curve compression to the standard ways of image compression.

This thesis describes the process of converting an image into strings using different algorithms.
These are then compressed using some compression tools, and the achieved results are compared.
Hilbert space-filling curve, Z-order curve, row-wise, column-wise, and diagonal-wise converting
image into a string is explained. For compression Zlib, 7zip, and Bzip2 are implemented. The
research results were analyzed and compared, and described the best combination of the image-to-
string converting algorithm and compression tool
